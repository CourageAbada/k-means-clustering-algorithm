Compulsory Task 22 - Interpretation

1.) Using the kmeans algorithm and the use of 3 clusters from the data1953.csv file, the records have indicated a lower life expectancy 
higher birth rate in the 3rd world countries. The 1st world countries are more likely to have better access to education, better health care
for those countries to be able to have a high life expectancy and a lower birth rate. Another observation I noticed is that
the data from 1953 to 2008 have shown that life expectancy and birth rate for almost all the countries had significantly increased.

2.) Both text files have indicated that there has been a higher life expectancy.The clusters have shown that they have moved up in the 
graph and this is most likely to the contribution of better healthcare. The countries in 2008 have indicated a higher life expectancy and 
birth rate than the data from 1953. There will always be an advancement of medicine, not all countries will have access to the best 
health care, but the date had shown that the statistics did not decline. There are more countries from 1953 now in 2008 as medicine becomes 
accessibile (though costly), especially in the 3rd world countries. The same cannot be said for any 1953 country clusters that might be formed in
2008 because most of them are relatively loose and mostly focused on a high birth rate rather than a high life expectancy. A country such 
as South Africa has initaed for a higher life expectancy.
